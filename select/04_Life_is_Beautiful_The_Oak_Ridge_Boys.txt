Let's go drifting, through the trees
Let's go sailing, on the sea
Let's go dancing, on the jukejoint floor
Leave our troubles, have a party

So easily forgotten are the most important things
Like the melody and the moonlight in your eyes
And a song that lasts forever
Each song getting better all the time

Life is beautiful, life is wondrous
Every star above, shining just for us
Life is beautiful, on a stormy night
Somewhere in the world, the sun is shining bright

I get crazy, so afraid
That I might lose you, some fine day
And I'll be nothing, but a tired old man
And I don't want to be without you, at the party

So easily forgotten, is the most important thing
Is that I love you, I do
And I want to spend my days and nights
Walking through this crazy world with you

Life is beautiful, life is wondrous
Every star above, shining just for us
Life is beautiful, on a stormy night
Somewhere in the world, the sun is shining bright

So easily forgotten, is the most important thing
Is that I love you, I do
And I want to spend my days and nights
Walking through this crazy world with you

Life is beautiful, life is wondrous
Every star above, shining just for us
Life is beautiful, on a stormy night
Somewhere in the world
The sun is shine, shining bright
